            <p class="about-description">Welcome to my personal webpage! 
            <br />Since 2020, I've been involved in building mobile and data-web applications within the healthcare sector.
            <br />
            <br />At C MARC, we've developed a 'Prescription Performance & Market Intelligence Platform' for pharmaceutical companies
            <br />in the Indian market, enabling them to gain valuable insights into their brand and market performance.
            <br />
            <br />Additionally, I've managed Product and Growth responsibilities for a 
            <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mood-tracker-my-journal-diary/id6473817855">Mood Tracking mobile app</a>, 
            <br />available on both iOS and Android, with a user base primarily in the United States.
            <br />
            <br />I’ve primarily used Python, SQL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with their associated frameworks and libraries.
            <br />Beyond my professional pursuits, I maintain an active lifestyle through workouts and running. 
            <br />I also have a passion for poker and entrepreneurship, having invested in several startups over the past few years.
            <br />
            <br />Feel free to drop me a message to learn more about the products I've worked on, 
            <br />my personal interests, or to explore common interests. Let's connect!
